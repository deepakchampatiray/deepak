Taking command of an operation or project, then guiding it to new performance levels, is my greatest strength.

My experience encompasses project management, strategic planning, resource utilization, revenue growth, and cost reduction. My ability to analyze needs and create unique solutions designed to yield a profitable outcome has proven to be one of my greatest assets.

Credited with significantly impacting bottom-line profitability wherever I have worked, I excel at streamlining less-than-efficient procedures to boost productivity and sales. Proactive management of crucial external relationships allowed me to increase revenue by 23% in one year. I also negotiated exclusive relationships in a key market segment, expanding the company's share of that segment by 66%.

I know that my proven leadership skills, strong commitment to high ethical and professional standards, and flexibility in devising proactive responses to changing socioeconomic conditions allows me to make a significant contribution to any team.
